FlexLabs.Util.Web
==========

A NuGet extension that helps automate and simplify some common tasks in MVC projects.

Contains the TablePager and some new html editor extensions

---

The table pager doesn't have a lot of documentation at the moment, but it would make it rather simple adding paging to a website and pager/page size controls.

The previous version of the plugin had a demo project here: http://www.flexlabs.org/NuGet/TablePager

A new set of documentation and a new demo project will be released in the future.
